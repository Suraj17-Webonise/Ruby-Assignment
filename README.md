# Ruby-Assignment : Reviewer : Balakrishna Allu 
Q1) Compute the sum of cubes for a given range a through b. Write a method called sum_of_cubes to accomplish this task. Example Given range 1 to 3 the method should return 36.
Q2) Given an Array, return the elements that are present exactly once in the array. You need to write a method called non_duplicated_values to accomplish this task. 
Example: Given [1,2,2,3,3,4,5], the method should return [1,4,5].
Q3) Given a sentence, return true if the sentence is a palindrome. You are supposed to write a method palindrome? to accomplish this task.
Note Ignore whitespace and cases of characters. Example: Given ""Never odd or even"" the method should return true.
Q4) 9 is a Kaprekar number since 9 ^ 2 = 81 and 8 + 1 = 9, 297 is also Kaprekar number since 297 ^ 2 = 88209 and 88 + 209 = 297. 
In short, for a Kaprekar number k with n-digits, if you square it and add the right n digits to the left n or n-1 digits, the resultant sum is k. Find if a given number is a Kaprekar number.String 1 :
RUBY parses a file by looking for <br/> one of the special tags that tells it to start interpreting the text as RUBY code. The parser then executes all of the code it finds until it runs into a RUBY closing <br/> tag.String 2 :
RUBY does not require (or support) explicit type definition in variable declaration; a variable's type is determined by the context in which the variable is used.
Q5) Find occurrence of RUBY from string 1.
Q6) Find the position where RUBY occurs in the string 1.
Q7) Create array of words in string 1 & print them using a recursive function.
Q8) Capitalise string 1
Q9) Combine string 1 & 2.
Q10) Print current date.
Q11) print 12th Jan 2012
Q12) add 7 days in current date
Q13) Cut the string 1 into 4 parts & print it.
Q14) Divide the string 1 by occurrences of '.'. Combine the array in reverse word sequence
Q15) Remove the HTML characters from string.
Q16) Print the 'RUBY' word from string 1 by traversing it using string functions
Q17) Find the length of string 1 & 2.
Q18) Compare two dates. (12-04-2010 & 12-05-2011). Calculate the days between these two dates.
Q19) Print date after 20 days from current date
Q20) Print date in array format.
Q21) Print prime numbers from the given array
Q22) Write a program for fuel indication.
Ex: 0 -> Out of fuel, 1-10 -> Low, Please fill, 11-30 -> Good for now, 31-50 -> Almost Full, > 50 -> Full
Q23) Swap the given values(without the third variable)
Q24) Program to Randomly Select an Element From the Array
Q25) Program to Count the Number of Each Vowel
Q26) Program to Sort a Hash by Value
Q27) Program to Convert Two Arrays Into a Hash
